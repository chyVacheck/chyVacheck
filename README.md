### About me
  > I have been fascinated with programming since my school days. I have always been passionate about creating programs and applications that can solve real problems. When I realized that I wanted to devote my life to programming, the choice fell on web development. This is a unique area that provides limitless opportunities for the implementation of creative ideas. One of its main advantages is that the results of the work can be seen almost instantly. For me, web development is not just a job, but an opportunity to create something new and useful for people every day.
